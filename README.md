UT Internet Engineering Spring 98 Project  
JobInja is a job-finding system for programmers. The base logic for assigning projects to users is auction. In this system, each project has a list of required skills and the maximum payement value. Users with different levels of skills bid for projects and at the end,
this system will choose the best user for the projects.  
  
This repository contains front end part of the project.
